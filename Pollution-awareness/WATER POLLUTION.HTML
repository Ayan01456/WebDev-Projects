<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#6772FF SIZE=5>Water they say is life, and indeed they were right. With about 70% of the earth’s cover being water,
 it undeniably becomes one of our greatest resources. As young students, we learned about the various ways to conserve water;
 coming to think of it, water is used in almost every important human chores and processes. It is an important element in both
 domestic as well as industrial purposes. However a closer inspection of our water resources today, give us a rude shock.Water
 pollution is an appalling problem, powerful enough to lead the world on a path of destruction. Water is an easy solvent, enabling
 most pollutants to dissolve in it easily and contaminate it. The most basic effect of water pollution is directly suffered by the
 organisms and vegetation that survive in water, including amphibians. On a human level, several people die each day due to
 consumption of polluted and infected water.</FONT>

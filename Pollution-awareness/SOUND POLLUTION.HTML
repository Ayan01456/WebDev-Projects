<P><FONT COLOR=#A4AB21 SIZE=5><JUSTIFY>Sound Pollution is the propagation of noise with harmful impact on the activity of human or 
animal life. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and transportation
 systems.Poor urban planning may give rise to noise pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential
 buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in 
residential areas include loud music, transportation noise, lawn care maintenance, nearby construction, or
 young people yelling (sports games). Noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an
 emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations. The average noise level of 97.60 dB obtained
 exceeded the WHO value of 50 dB allowed for residential areas.Research suggests that noise pollution is
 the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods.</FONT></JUSTIFY></P>

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#A4AB21" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#757B17 SIZE=6><B>1. Industrialization:</B></FONT>Most of the industries
 use big machines which are capable of producing large amount of noise. Apart from that, various equipments like
 compressors, generators, exhaust fans, grinding mills also participate in producing big noise. Therefore, you must
 have seen workers in these factories and industries wearing ear plugs to minimize the effect of noise.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#A4AB21" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#757B17 SIZE=6><B>2. Social Events:</B></FONT>Noise is at its peak in most of the
 social events. Whether it is marriage, parties, pub, disc or place of worship, people normally flout rules set by the local
 administration and create nuisance in the area. People play songs on full volume and dance till midnight which makes the
 condition of people living nearby pretty worse.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#A4AB21" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#757B17 SIZE=6><B>3. Transportation:</B></FONT>Large number of vehicles on roads,
 aeroplanes flying over houses, underground trains produce heavy noise and people get it difficult to get accustomed to that.
 The high noise leads to a situation wherein a normal person lose the ability to hear properly.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#A4AB21" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#757B17 SIZE=6><B>4. Construction Activities:</B></FONT>Under construction activities
 like mining, construction of bridges, dams, buildings, stations, roads, flyovers take place in almost every part of the world.
 These construction activities take place everyday as we need more buildings, bridges to accommodate more people and to reduce
 traffic congestion. The down point is that these construction equipments are too noisy.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#A4AB21" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#757B17 SIZE=6><B>5. Household Chores:</B></FONT>We people are surrounded by gadgets 
and use them extensively in our daily life. Gadgets like TV, mobile , mixer grinder, pressure cooker, vacuum cleaners , washing
 machine and dryer, cooler, air conditioners are minor contributors to the amount of noise that is produced but it affects the
 quality of life of your neighborhood in a bad way.

<P><FONT COLOR=#A4AB21 SIZE=5><JUSTIFY>High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an 
increased incidence of coronary artery disease.In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by
 altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute
 to permanent hearing loss.While the elderly may have cardiac problems due to noise, according to the World
 Health Organization, children are especially vulnerable to noise, and the effects that noise has on children
 may be permanent.Noise poses a serious threat to a child’s physical and psychological health, and may
 negatively interfere with a child's learning and behavior,such as thinking screams or yelling are acceptable
 for any library, courtroom, church or classical music.<FONT COLOR=#757B17><B>Therefore the effects of sound pollution are:</B></JUSTIFY></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR=#A4AB21 SIZE=5><FONT COLOR=#757B17><B>The easy & practical ways to reduce sound pollution are 1. Close the windows,2. Put in earplugs,3. Improve your
insulation,4. Intsall a fence,5. Invest in noice friendly flooring,6. Use of morden acoustic Wall panels
,7. Turn of the electrical or reduce the volume,8. Plant trees, etc.</B></FONT>The Hierarchy of Controls concept is often used to reduce noise in the environment or the workplace. Engineering
 noise controls can be used to reduce noise propagation and protect individuals from overexposure. When noise controls
 are not feasible or adequate, individuals can also take steps to protect themselves from the harmful effects of noise
 pollution. If people must be around loud sounds, they can protect their ears with hearing protection
 (e.g., ear plugs or ear muffs).In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to
 combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage
 manufacturers to design quieter equipment.</FONT></P></TD>

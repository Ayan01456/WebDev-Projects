<P><FONT COLOR=#AB774B SIZE=5><JUSTIFY>Thermal pollution is defined as sudden increase or decrease in temperature of a
 natural body of water which may be ocean, lake, river or pond by human influence. This normally occurs
 when a plant or facility takes in water from a natural resource and puts it back with an altered temperature.
 Usually, these facilities use it as a cooling method for their machinery or to help better produce their products.
Plants that produce different products or waste water facilities are often the culprits of this massive exodus of thermal
 pollution. In order to properly control and maintain thermal pollution, humans and governments have been taking many
 steps to effectively manage how plants are able to use the water. However, the effects are still lasting today.</FONT>

Production and Manufacturing plants are biggest source of thermal pollution. These plants draw water from nearby source to keep machines cool
 and then release back to the source with higher temperature. When heated water returns to the river or ocean, the water temperature rises
 sharply. When oxygen levels are altered in the water, this can also degrade the quality and longevity of life in wildlife that lives underwater.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#AB774B" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#745032 SIZE=6><B>2. Soil Erosion:</B></FONT>Soil erosion is another major factor that causes thermal
 pollution. Consistent soil erosion causes water bodies to rise, making them more exposed to sunlight. The high temperature could prove fatal
 for aquatic biomes as it may give rise to anaerobic conditions.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#AB774B" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#745032 SIZE=6><B>3. Deforestation:</B></FONT>Trees and plants prevent sunlight from falling directly
 on lakes, ponds or rivers. When deforestation takes place, these water bodies are directly exposed to sunlight, thus absorbing more heat and
 raising its temperature.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#AB774B" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#745032 SIZE=6><B>4. Runoff from Paved Surfaces:</B></FONT>Urban runoff discharged to surface waters
 from paved surfaces like roads and parking lots can make water warmer. During summer seasons, the pavement gets quite hot, which creates
 warm runoff that gets into the sewer systems and water bodies.
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#AB774B" SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#745032 SIZE=6><B>5. Natural Causes:</B></FONT>Natural causes like volcanoes and geothermal activity
 under the oceans and seas can trigger warm lava to raise the temperature of water bodies. Lightening can also introduce massive amount of
 heat into the oceans. This means that the overall temperature of the water source will rise, having significant impacts on the environment.

<H3><FONT COLOR=#745032 SIZE=8><U>Effects of Thermal Pollution</U></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT COLOR=#AB774B SIZE=5><JUSTIFY>Among recognized scientists and scholars, there are generally two schools of
 thought when it comes to the effects of thermal pollution. Some lean on the side of the negatives of this pollution
 on marine ecosystems and how it is detrimental to positive environmental practices. However, some lean towards the
 side that without these industries operating the way they do, then some of the most basic parts of human life would
 be completely obsolete. Waste water would not be able to be properly maintained, we would have no industries that 
could produce the goods we need, and so on. The effects of thermal pollution on ecosystems, however, greatly outweigh
 the benefits that industries have by participating in the act.

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE=5>With the rise of concrete buildings and roads, one part of the Earth that we rarely see is the soil.
 It has many different names, such as dirt, mud and ground. However, it is definitely very important to us. The plants that
 feed us grow in soil and keeping it healthy is essential to maintaining a beautiful planet. However, like all other forms
 of nature, soil also suffers from pollution. The pollution of soil is a common thing these days, and it happens due to the
 presence of man made elements.The main reason why the soil becomes contaminated is due to the presence of man made waste.
 The waste produced from nature itself such as dead plants, carcasses of animals and rotten fruits and vegetables only adds
 to the fertility of the soil. However, our waste products are full of chemicals that are not originally found in nature and
 lead to soil pollution.</FONT>

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>1. Industrial Activity:</B></FONT>Industrial activity has been the biggest
 contributor to the problem in the last century, especially since the amount of mining and manufacturing has increased. Most
 industries are dependent on extracting minerals from the Earth. Whether it is iron ore or coal, the by products are contaminated
 and they are not disposed off in a manner that can be considered safe.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>2. Agricultural Activities:</B></FONT>Chemical utilization has gone up
 tremendously since technology provided us with modern pesticides and fertilizers. They are full of chemicals that are
 not produced in nature and cannot be broken down by it. As a result, they seep into the ground after they mix with water
 and slowly reduce the fertility of the soil. Other chemicals damage the composition of the soil and make it easier to
 erode by water and air.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>3. Waste Disposal:</B></FONT>Finally, a growing cause for concern
 is how we dispose of our waste. While industrial waste is sure to cause contamination, there is another way in which
 we are adding to the pollution. Every human produces a certain amount of personal waste products by way or urine and feces.</FONT>

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>4. Accidental Oil Spills:</B></FONT>Oil leaks can happen during storage
 and transport of chemicals. This can be seen at most of the fuel stations. The chemicals present in the fuel deteriorates
 the quality of soil and make them unsuitable for cultivation. These chemicals  can enter into the groundwater through soil
 and make the water undrinkable.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>5. Acid Rain:</B></FONT>Acid rain is caused when pollutants present in
 the air mixes up with the rain and fall back on the ground. The polluted water could dissolve away some of the important
 nutrients found in soil and change the structure of the soil.</FONT>

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>1. Effect on Health of Humans:</B></FONT>Considering how soil is the reason we are able
 to sustain ourselves, the contamination of it has major consequences on our health. Crops and plants grown on polluted soil absorb much of the
 pollution and then pass these on to us.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>2. Effect on Growth of Plants:</B></FONT>The ecological balance of any system gets
 affected due to the widespread contamination of the soil. Most plants are unable to adapt when the chemistry of the soil changes so radically
 in a short period of time.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>3. Decreased Soil Fertility:</B></FONT>The toxic chemicals present in the soil can
 decrease soil fertility and therefore decrease in the soil yield. The contaminated soil is then used to produce fruits and vegetables which
 lacks quality nutrients and may contain some poisonous substance to cause serious health problems in people consuming them.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>4. Toxic Dust:</B></FONT>The emission of toxic and foul gases from landfills pollutes
 the environment and causes serious effects on health of some people. The unpleasant smell causes inconvenience to other people.</FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>5. Changes in Soil Structure:</B></FONT>The death of many soil organisms (e.g. earthworms)
 in the soil can lead to alteration in soil structure. Apart from that, it could also force other predators to move to other places in search of food.</FONT>

<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE=6><B>1. Make people aware about the concept of Reduce, Recycle and Reuse.</B></FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>2. Reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities.</B></FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>4. Ensure that you do not litter on the ground and do proper disposal of garbage.</B></FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>5. Buy biodegradable products.</B></FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>6. Do Organic gardening and eat organic food that will be grown without the use of pesticides.</B></FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#137846 SIZE=6><B>7. Create dumping ground away from residential areas, etc.</B></FONT>
</JUSTIFY>
<P><JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR=#169154 SIZE=5>Several creatures survive under the land too. Disrupting the harmony of the land, is disrupting their habitat.
 This has led to several creatures reaching the endangered status like the Gilbert’s Potoroo in Australia.
We walk and survive on land. It is literally the base of our ecosystem. It is in our good interest to take care of it and nurture it.</FONT>
